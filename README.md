<h2>Routing</h2> 
 <p>Basically used for leading the user to wanted URL</p><br>
<p><b>As an example:</b></p><br>
<p>User clicks on All cards from the menu. In order to reach All cards, the URL adress has to be ../Frames/allcards.html(<b>example</b>) in our case. But we do not want user to write it to browser Instead, we route "All cards" in menu to that specific url.</p>
<br>
<p>To do this with node.js, we need a framework such as express.js</p>
<br>
<p>first we need to install it via  <br> <b>npm install express</b> </p>
<br>
